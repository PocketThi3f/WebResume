# WebResume
I'm an aspiring Junior Web Developer, with a background in Field Service IT, Environmental Science/Studies and Real Estate.

I am teaching myself again to become a Front-End Developer that specializes in React.js.

I'm not difficult to work with, I make fast friends and I push myself to get tasks done.


## Experience:
### UCLA Extension Web Development Program (2016-2017)
I took part in UCLA's Web Development program, where I took the opportunity to become a fully-fledged junior web dev, focusing on learning both front and back-end technologies.

I also took part in the City of LA's repository, where I contributed to the CSS and PostgresSQL database changes.
